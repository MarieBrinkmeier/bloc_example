# BLOC Example

The Weather Forecast App is a simple, user-friendly application developed using Flutter.
It employs the BLOC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management, ensuring a clean separation between the UI (User Interface) and business logic.

### Add API key

Don't forget to provide the [OpenWeather API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) as runtime parameter:
